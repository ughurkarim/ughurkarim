## Hi there 👋, my name is Ughur Karim

I’m a UCLA student studying **Computer Science and Mathematics**, interested in building software that is thoughtful and genuinely useful.

Currently, I enjoy working as a full-stack software engineer. I’m especially drawn to projects that improve my skillset and shape into something useful. I care about clarity in both code and design, and I’m always striving to improve my approach to problem-solving.

Over time, I’ve worked on full-stack web applications, database-backed systems, and desktop software. I’ve built projects using various technologies as well as lower-level languages, and I enjoy switching between them depending on the problem. I prefer learning by building, rather than just reading or following tutorials.

Outside of programming, I enjoy weightlifting, running, reading books, watching soccer and basketball, and spending time with my little sister. I value balance and steady growth, and I try to bring that mindset into both my work and everyday life.

In the long term, I hope to turn my curiosity into impact by developing technology that helps people in meaningful ways. I’m always open to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and grow as an engineer.
